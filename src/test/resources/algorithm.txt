Prerequisities: All stations are nodes and distance between stations as cost of the edge
                For each node initialise to infinity
                Start node initialise to 0


Steps: While all nodes are not done
       Start at start node
       Find all immediate neighbours to it
       Iterate over each immediate neighbours
       For each immediate neighbour add initial value of node to edge value
       If new value < previous value then
       Update value of immediate neighbour node
       Else keep the previous value
       Repeat for other nodes until final destination is achieved
