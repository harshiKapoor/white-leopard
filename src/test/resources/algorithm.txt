Prerequisities: All stations are nodes and distance between stations as cost of the edge
                Start node is initialised to 0
                All other nodes are initialised to infinity

Steps: Start at node start node
       Find all immediate neighbours to start node
       Iterate over all each immediate neighbours of start node
       For each immediate neighbour Add initial value of start node to edge value (which would be 0+cost of edge which is distance between stations)
       If new value < previous value
       Update value of immediate neighbour node
       Repeat for other nodes until final destination is achieved
